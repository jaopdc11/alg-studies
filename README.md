# 🧠 Studies on Algorithms

## Welcome to my repository dedicated to studying algorithms! 🎉

### 1. What is an Algorithm? 🤔

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It consists of a finite sequence of well-defined instructions aimed at accomplishing a specific task or computation. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, including natural language, pseudocode, or programming languages.

### 2. Types of Algorithms 🔍

In this repository, we focus on two main types of algorithms: **Sorting** and **Searching**.

#### 2.1 Sorting Algorithms 📊

**Sorting algorithms** arrange the elements of a list or array in a certain order (usually in ascending or descending order). The efficiency of sorting algorithms is crucial for optimizing data processing and retrieval.

#### 2.2 Searching Algorithms 🔎

**Searching algorithms** are used to locate a specific element or value within a data structure. They are essential for data retrieval and can greatly affect the performance of applications that handle large datasets.

### 3. Complexity of Algorithms 📈

The **complexity** of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of computational resources (time and space) that it requires. Understanding algorithm complexity helps developers make informed decisions about which algorithm to use based on the context and constraints of their applications. 

Complexity is often expressed using **Big O notation**, which categorizes algorithms based on their worst-case or average-case performance:

- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time complexity
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time complexity

### 4. The Algorithms I Implemented 💻

Here are the sorting and searching algorithms I've implemented in this repository:

#### Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
  **Complexity**: O(n²)

- **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.  
  **Complexity**: O(n log n) on average, O(n²) in the worst case.

- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.  
  **Complexity**: O(n log n)

#### Searching Algorithms:
- **Linear Search**: A straightforward searching algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the target value is found or the list ends.  
  **Complexity**: O(n)

- **Binary Search**: An efficient searching algorithm that requires the list to be sorted. It divides the list in half and eliminates half of the search space with each comparison.  
  **Complexity**: O(log n)
